# Trello Clone Project

Welcome to our Trello clone project! This is a group project created by the cohorts of Parsity's coding bootcamp. We're building a Trello clone using agile development methodology over the course of a four week part-time sprint.

## About Trello

Trello is a popular project management tool that allows users to create boards, lists, and cards to organize and prioritize tasks. Our goal is to replicate the basic functionality of Trello, including the ability to create and manage boards, lists, and cards, as well as drag-and-drop functionality for moving cards between lists.

## Features

Here are some of the key features we plan to include in our Trello clone:

User authentication and authorization
Ability to create and manage boards, lists, and cards
Drag-and-drop functionality for moving cards between lists
Real-time updates using WebSockets
Integration with a database for persistent data storage

## Technology Stack

Our Trello clone is built using the following technologies:

React.js and Redux Toolkit for the frontend (using React-DnD)
Node.js and Express for the backend
MongoDB and Mongoose for the database
